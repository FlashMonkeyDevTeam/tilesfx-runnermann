This is a Maven Version of the Beautiful Gauge Library by Hansolo. The java version has been updated to Java 17 as well as JavaFX 17. 

This version has modifications to two gauges. 

1. The TimeTile is now a timer
2. The Countdown Timer uses multiple colors. In its current configuration if it is counting down to 0 it is green. It continues to count past 0 and turn yellow on the second round, orange on the third, red on the fouth. After the fourth the bar no longer shows, but the time continues to tick. 

For licensing all licenses remain in tact from its original author.
